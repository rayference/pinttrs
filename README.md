## Motivation

The amazing [`attrs`](https://www.attrs.org) library is a game-changer when it
comes to writing classes. Its initialisation sequence notably allows for
automated conversion and verification of attribute values. This package is an
attempt at designing a system to apply units automatically and reliably to
attributes with [Pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io).

## Features

- Attach automatically units to unitless values passed to initialise an attribute
- Verify unit compatibility when assigning a value to an attribute
- Interpret units in dictionaries with a simple syntax
- Define unit context to vary unitless value interpretation dynamically
